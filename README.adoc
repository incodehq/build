This module defines a standard parent POM to use for various Incode applications and modules.
Its primary purpose is to make it easy to use a set up link:https://github.com/odavid/maven-plugins[maven mixin]s within child POMs; specifically to hold the required `<pluginManagement>` so that versions of plugins are locked down.

See below for details of the maven mixins so configured.

[NOTE]
====
This pom does _not_ define any plugins for Apache Isis, so is independent of the release cycle of that framework.
====


== Contents

This parent POM defines `<properties>` and `<pluginManagement>` for the plugins defined in the following maven mixins:

== How to Configure

To configure:

* inherit from this pom: +
+
[source,xml]
----
<parent>
    <groupId>org.incode</groupId>
    <artifactId>incode-build</artifactId>
    <version>6</version>
</parent>
----
+
This has the effect of defining a number of `<properties>` (eg `${mavenmixin-surefire.version}`) and also the setting up the `<pluginManagement>` of all of the plugins referenced by the above maven mixins.

* for each maven mixin required in the consuming module, just add the corresponding `<mixin>` to: +

[source,xml]
----
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>com.github.odavid.maven.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>mixin-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>0.1-alpha-39</version>
            <extensions>true</extensions>
            <configuration>
                <mixins>
                    ...                                         <!--1-->
                </mixins>
            </configuration>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
----
<1> add in mixin reference here.

[TIP]
====
Just copy-n-paste from the fourth column of the above table,
====

For example, to enable the https://github.com/danhaywood/java-mavenmixin-surefire[surefire] mixin, just add:

[source,xml]
----
<mixin>
    <groupId>com.danhaywood.mavenmixin</groupId>
    <artifactId>surefire</artifactId>
</mixin>
----

=== Dependencies

This mixin module relies on the link:https://github.com/odavid/maven-plugins[com.github.odavid.maven.plugins:mixin-maven-plugin], released under Apache License v2.0.



== Maven deploy notes

The module is deployed using Sonatype's OSS support (see
http://central.sonatype.org/pages/apache-maven.html[user guide] and http://www.danhaywood.com/2013/07/11/deploying-artifacts-to-maven-central-repo/[this blog post]).

The `release.sh` script automates the release process.
It performs the following:

* performs a sanity check (`mvn clean install -o`) that everything builds ok
* bumps the `pom.xml` to a specified release version, and tag
* performs a double check (`mvn clean install -o`) that everything still builds ok
* releases the code using `mvn clean deploy`
* bumps the `pom.xml` to a specified release version

For example:

[source]
----
sh release.sh 6 \
              7-SNAPSHOT \
              dan@haywood-associates.co.uk \
              "this is not really my passphrase"
----

where

* `$1` is the release version
* `$2` is the snapshot version
* `$3` is the email of the secret key (`~/.gnupg/secring.gpg`) to use for signing
* `$4` is the corresponding passphrase for that secret key.

Other ways of specifying the key and passphrase are available, see the ``pgp-maven-plugin``'s
http://kohsuke.org/pgp-maven-plugin/secretkey.html[documentation]).

If the script completes successfully, then push changes:

[source]
----
git push origin master && git push origin 6
----

If the script fails to complete, then identify the cause, perform a `git reset --hard` to start over and fix the issue before trying again.
Note that in the `dom`'s `pom.xml` the `nexus-staging-maven-plugin` has the `autoReleaseAfterClose` setting set to `true` (to automatically stage, close and the release the repo).
You may want to set this to `false` if debugging an issue.

According to Sonatype's guide, it takes about 10 minutes to sync, but up to 2 hours to update http://search.maven.org[search].
